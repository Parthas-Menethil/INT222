						<h3>Japanese Anime</h3>
						<p>
						Anime is the Japanese largest industry. The development model of Japanese Anime has a strong national feature. For example, we can see the real beauty of Asians and their unique cultures. This is what other countries are lack of. Although Japanese Anime does not have amazing glitzy special effects as American animations, with its creative plot and entertaining theme, it has concrete viewers all around the world.

						<h4>The three climaxes in Japanese Anime history</h4>
						<p>
						“Neon Genesis Evangelion”, “Space Battleship Yamato” and “Gundam0079” are the three climaxes in Japanese Anime history.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
						The latest one “Neon Genesis Evangelion”, with the revolutionary stream of consciousness and the use of religion as well as philosophy, made it a milestone. It recalled people to think about their deep mind and reflected the society at the beginning of the twenty first century. We can even see its pattern in Cameron’s film – Avatar such as the Sync Rate and the neuron connections.

						<h3>Things About This Page</h3>
						<p>This other page is designed as a website's home page to meet daily personal and business requirements. The carousel currently is only a skeleton with no soul of javascript. Although this is only an assignment, I made the whole layout for later use of my website. The style is designed as simple and clear which gives a complete refreshment to new visitors.
